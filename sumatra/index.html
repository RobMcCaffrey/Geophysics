The magnitude 9.0 December 26, 2004, earthquake near Sumatra is the largest earthquake to occur since the 1964 Alaska quake and the fourth largest in this century.
<p>It apparently ruptured the section of the Sumatra subduction zone from northern Sumatra northward for about 1000 kilometers. The rupture area is outlined by aftershocks;

<br>Aftershocks through mid March</center>

<p>The Sumatra subduction zone is where the Indian plate dives beneath the Asian plate along a fault that dips about 20<sup>o</sup> into the Earth.
Because of the low dip angle, earthquakes can rupture along a very large surface area of the fault, producing such large magnitudes. 
In fact, the 10 largest earthquakes since 1900 have occurred at subduction zones (see
<a href = http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/10maps_world.html>http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/10maps_world.html</a>).

<p>The huge and destructive tsunami was the direct result of the earthquake disturbing the seafloor and displacing an enormous volume of water. The disturbance spreads from the epicenter like ripples in a pond but, unlike circular ripples, is stronger in some directions than others due to the nature of the faulting.

(from the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology)

<br>Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Yehuda Bock, Jeff Genrich, Linette Prawirodirdjo
<br>BAKOSURTANAL (Indonesian Mapping Agency): Jakub Rais, Cecep Subarya, Toto Puntodewo


<p>Since 1989, we have been monitoring crustal motion throughout Indonesia
with Scripps Inst. of Oceanography and BAKOSURTANAL using the Global Positioning
System.

<p>Starting in 1989, we established a more dense network of GPS monitoring sites in Northern Sumatra. These show that the subduction zone was steadily squeezing the island of Sumatra, loading the system for the next earthquake.

The orange shaded areas are the rupture areas of the 1833 magnitude 8.7 earthquake and the 1861 magnitude 8.4 quake. The 12/26 magnitude 9.0 quake apparently ruptured fom the north edge of the 1861 event all the way north to the northern end of the subduction zone. From Prawirodirdjo et al.
