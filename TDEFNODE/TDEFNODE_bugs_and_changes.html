<p> 9-11-15:  'sp 8' under ES: does not work as described
</p><p> 9-17-15: Revised td_plot and td_flag; download new <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/%7Emccaf/defnode/manual/td_plot">td_plot</a> and <a href="http://web.pdx.edu/%7Emccaf/defnode/manual/td_flags">td_flags</a>

</p><p>10-19-15: Incorrect decimation of time series. Delete or comment out line (around line 6254) 
</p><pre>      if (Tdec .eq. zero .and. npts.gt.500 ) Tdec = 10.0d0/365.25d0
</pre>
<br>Unnecessary zeroing of arrays. Delete or comment out the 6 lines starting around line 28297:
<pre>      NN = MAX_ii*npmax
      call cleareal(aa,NN)
      call cleareal(r,MAX_ii)
      call cleareal(s,MAX_ii)
      call cleareal(pp,Npmax)
      call clearint(ipar,Npmax)
</pre>

<p> 2-25-17:  TDEFNODE source code updated
</p><p> 4-6-17:  'NVg:' option does not work as described, use NV: instead
</p><p> 7-26-17:
InSAR data: Earlier version had an error in calculating east and north 
InSAR displacements. This has been fixed. 
The program reads the look vector as ground to satellite unit vector or 
calculates it from incidence angle and heading. 
The sign is reversed when dotted with surface displacement vector, so 
that calculated change in LOS is negative if ground moves toward 
satellite.
If your data are opposite, that is, positive LOS change is shortening of
 the distance to the satellite, use a negative for the file index number
 in the IS: line, 
which flips the sign of the LOS change as they are read in. </p>
<p> 7-27-17: Fixed IC: 0 option to correctly add elastic component to predicted velocities. Source code updated.
