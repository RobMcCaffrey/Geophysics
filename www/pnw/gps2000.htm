<p><h4> The  map shows our 2000 campaign network occupied from June 4 - 28.
We occupied 89 sites with an average occupation time of 26 hours (median of 10 hours).
BIGC, PAUL, JONY, HANS, SPRO, BRAE, P520,
and CEDC were run as semi-continuous sites for periods of a few days to 2 weeks.

<p> Several of the sites in Washington were occupied simultaneously by the University of Washington GPS group.
