<b>DEFNODE bugs and clarifications:</b>

<p><b>12-3-08: line 2050</b><br> The 'sort' command needs the -n option to sort correctly  
the Green's functions for GPS sites that have negative longitudes. If you are 
using negative longitudes and the sites use Green's functions, 
make the change below, recompile and re-generate your Green's functions. 
(Thanks to P. Vernant)

<pre>

** sort the file loc_dn.tmp and put in loc2_dn.tmp
       x = system('sort -n '//expdir//'loc_dn.tmp > 
     .    '//expdir//'loc2_dn.tmp')

</pre>

<p><b>12-15-08: Manual</b><br> Under the HC command exlanation, the format line:
<pre>
hc:  I  Lon Lat BLK1 BLK2  Lower_value Upper_value
</pre>
and the examples:
<pre>
hc: 1 Noam Paci 232.5 32.1 24.0 34.0
hc: 2 Noam Paci 232.5 32.1 280.0 320.0
</pre>
are in disagreement. The correct format is give by the format line, the examples are wrong. (Thanks to S. Payne)

<p><b>1-6-09: Manual</b><br>
The Q% in the .summary file refers to the probability that the data are satsfied. Specifically, see Press et al (1989, page 502)
where Q is defined as the probability that the 'chi-square should exceed a particular value by chance'.
<p>
Under the 'Name' column, the P's refer to poles (eg, P005 for pole number 5), the S's refer to strain rate tensors, and G's refer to 
GPS velocity fields. The numbers are as you defined them in the control file. For example, for pole 5, P005 the statistics will be for all
GPS data that are trying to satisfy that pole, and may be from multiple blocks if they have the same pole.

<p><b>1-6-09: line 6580</b><br> Incorrect indexing of the GPS file in the .summary file. <br>Change:
<pre>
       call int2char(j, 3, c2)
to       
       call int2char(j, 3, a3)
</pre>       
(Thanks to R. Cakmak)

<p><b>5-20-09: </b><br> Some slight modifications were made to reduce the warnings from new gfortran. Also the bugs noted above were fixed.
